Responsible AI in the Earth Sciences: Ethics, Best Practices, and Roadmap

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, making it crucial for researchers and practitioners to follow ethical standards and best practices. In the field of Earth sciences, responsible AI plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and value of AI applications in our daily lives. Responsible AI involves establishing an ethical framework that guides AI development and application, although a comprehensive treatment for all applied AI research in the Earth sciences is still evolving. Nevertheless, several fundamental best practices and standards are currently available, with more on the horizon.

This chapter provides a concise overview of the basic standards for AI ethics and best practices that are readily accessible. It covers a wide range of topics, including ethical considerations for autonomous AI systems that utilize satellite data or sensor networks. Additionally, practical guidelines for documenting machine learning models are discussed. These principles serve as a roadmap for responsible development and use of AI in the Earth sciences, ensuring that AI applications align with ethical values and societal expectations.

By adhering to these standards, researchers and practitioners can promote transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems. This chapter aims to familiarize beginners with the foundational principles of responsible AI in the Earth sciences, providing insights into the essential aspects that need to be considered. As the field continues to evolve, adopting these ethical guidelines will foster trust and confidence in AI technologies, contributing to their responsible and beneficial integration into our society.
