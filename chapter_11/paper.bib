abstract = {As a result of changes in natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes, the extent of early-successional forest across much of eastern North American is near historic lows, and continues to decline. This has caused many scientists to identify the conservation of early-successional species as a high priority. In this synthesis, we discuss the conservation implications of this loss of early-successional habitats using examples from the literature on songbirds. Early-successional “shrubland” bird species require conditions and resources present in recently disturbed sites. These conditions are ephemeral and change rapidly over time as sites become dominated by later-seral species. Historical disturbance regimes such as wind-throw, fire and flooding have been altered or suppressed in eastern forests through human activity such as conversion of forests to younger aged stands more resistant to wind, fire suppression and mesophication of fire-adapted communities, and suppression of beaver activity and flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbance has shifted over much of the region to types of land use that provide less shrubland habitat of lower quality than historically. Despite scientific evidence in support of this concern, there is still misunderstanding about the role of disturbance in maintaining biodiversity, and public opposition to management remains a challenge to conserving these communities. Contemporary approaches use natural disturbance regimes to inform management practices that employ historical agents where possible or surrogates when necessary to achieve desired future conditions defined on the basis of regional population or community status. Conservation of early-successional communities occurs within the context of other potentially conflicting ecological values, such as the conservation and enhancement of biologically mature forest. Recent findings, however, show shrubland habitat can augment diversity in forested landscapes by providing seasonal resources for mature-forest species, such as food or predator-free space for juvenile forest songbirds that seek out early-successional habitats during the transition to independence. Balancing the conservation of early-successional shrubland species with other, sometimes conflicting values is an active area of current conservation research. In some cases the conservation of shrubland birds can be coordinated with commercial activities like silviculture or maintenance of infrastructure (e.g. powerline corridors), although our work indicates that deliberate efforts expressly directed at conservation of early-successional shrubland species are more effective.}

abstract = {Populations of a number of taxa associated with shrublands, early-successional forests, and other disturbance-generated habitats (collectively referred to as thickets) are declining in the northeastern United States. To assure that species dependent on thicket habitats persist, intervention is warranted. However, conservationists concerned with the status of thicket-dependent species are confronted with two important questions. How much habitat is needed? And how should these habitats be distributed? Natural disturbance regimes have been recommended as a baseline that managers should consider while providing thicket habitats. Within the Northeast, historic disturbance regimes varied substantially among forest types. Coastal regions were characterized by extensive barrens where regular and often times large-scale disturbances that resulted in >15% of the area being covered by regenerating forest stands. Among inland forests, natural disturbances were usually small and resulted in seedling-sapling stands and beaver (Castor canadensis) impoundments covering <6% of the area. Under these conditions, thicket-affiliated species were probably distributed in small, disjunct populations that shifted in space and time. Current efforts to maintain thicket habitats must deal with a range of current land-uses and a legacy of historic uses. Additionally, the effectiveness of management protocols that mimic natural disturbances is limited among many forests. Increasing ownership parcelization, a relatively young forest, and landscape fragmentation substantially reduce the practicality and suitability of small-scale disturbances for generating thicket habitats. Large, clustered patches may be more practical and beneficial, especially in urbanized landscapes. In rural areas, silvicultural manipulations should be applied on a “sliding scale” relative to forest age. Timber harvests that emulate the range of variability of natural disturbances may become appropriate in these areas as forest stands mature. Addressing the needs of thicket-dependent species in the northeastern United States will require creativity, a willingness to explore a variety of solutions, and public support.}

abstract = {The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is an operational land cover monitoring program providing updated land cover and related information for the United States at five-year intervals. NLCD2016 extends temporal coverage to 15 years (2001–2016). We collected land cover reference data for the 2011 and 2016 nominal dates to report land cover accuracy for the NLCD2016 database 2011 and 2016 land cover components at Level II and Level I and for Level I 2011–2016 land cover change using two definitions of agreement. For both the 2011 and 2016 land cover components, single-date Level II overall accuracies (OA) were 72% (standard error of ±0.9%) when agreement was defined as match between the map label and primary reference label only and 86% (± 0.7%) when agreement also included the alternate reference label. The corresponding level I OA for both dates were 79% (± 0.9%) and 91% (± 1.0%). The 2011–2016 user's and producer's accuracies (UA and PA) were ~ 75% for forest loss and PA for water loss, grassland loss, and grass gain were > 70% when agreement included a match between the map label and either the primary or alternate reference label. Depending on agreement definition and level of the classification hierarchy, OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2016 database was about 4% to 7% higher than OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2011 database, suggesting that the changes in mapping methodologies initiated for production of the NLCD2016 database have led to improved product quality. Additionally, we used the reference dataset collected for assessment of the NLCD2011 database to assess the 2001 and 2006 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. OA for the 2001 and 2006 land cover components was 1% - 5% lower than OA for the 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. Higher OA for 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database relative to OA for its 2001 and 2006 components may be attributable to differences in reference data quality.}
