# Chapter 13: Satellite image classification using quantum machine learning

Quantum Machine Learning for Satellite Image Classification

## Introduction

In this beginner-friendly chapter, we dive into the fascinating world of quantum machine learning (QML) and its application in classifying satellite-observed hyperspectral images to distinguish different land types, with a specific focus on vegetation.

It begins by providing an overview of QML, demystifying its fundamental concepts and principles. We then introduce the hyperspectral data that serves as the foundation for our classification task, highlighting its importance and unique characteristics.

Step by step, we guide you through the process of building quantum neural networks (QNNs), which are at the core of QML algorithms. You'll learn about qubits and how quantum circuits are constructed, empowering you to understand the inner workings of these advanced models.

Next, we explore data encoding techniques, demonstrating how classical data can be encoded into quantum circuits, enabling seamless integration with the QNN. This encoding process is crucial for leveraging the power of quantum computing in solving complex classification problems.

We showcased its training process and performance evaluation. Witness firsthand how this innovative model learns from the encoded data and makes accurate predictions, revolutionizing satellite image classification.

Drawing from the results obtained, we conclude by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of QML. Furthermore, we raise open-ended questions, pondering how QML might evolve in the near future, opening up new frontiers in the field of quantum-enhanced machine learning.

With this tutorials we are on the road to unlock the potential of quantum computing and machine learning, bridging the gap between classical and quantum paradigms. By exploring QML for satellite image classification, you'll gain insights into the cutting-edge technologies shaping our digital landscape.
