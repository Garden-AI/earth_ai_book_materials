# Chapter 2: Mapping Snow-Covered Area (SCA) Using Machine Learning and High-Resolution Satellite Imagery

Snow is an important component in the Earthâ€™s hydrological and energy cycles. This Jupyter book focuses on mapping snow-covered areas (SCA) using machine learning models and high-resolution satellite imagery, particularly from Planet small satellites. The chapter covers the challenges of SCA mapping, the use of machine learning models, and provides a workflow and tutorial materials for educational purposes. All scripts and datasets are available in the accompanying GitHub Repository.
